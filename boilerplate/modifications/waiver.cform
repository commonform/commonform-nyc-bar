    \ Waiver \ A party may by written instrument signed on behalf of such party:
        \\ extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of another party due to it,
        \\ waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to it contained in this <Agreement> or any <Transaction Document>, or
        \\ waive compliance with any covenants, obligations, or conditions in its favor contained in this <Agreement> or in any <Transaction Document>. No claim or right arising out of this <Agreement> or any <Transaction Document> can be waived by a party, in whole or in part, unless made in a writing signed by such party. Neither any course of conduct or dealing nor failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this <Agreement> or any of the <Transaction Documents> will operate as a waiver of such right, power, or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power, or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. A waiver given by a party will be applicable only to the specific instance for which it is given.
